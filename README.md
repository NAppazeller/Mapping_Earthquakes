# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this project, we'll use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

## Approach
We'll use JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Using the Leaflet library, we'll plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
